# ========== Introduction ==========
"""
A trait is a set of requirement that a type must implement (like a prototype).
Think of it as a contract: a type that conforms to a trait, guarantees that it implements all of the features of the trait.

Traits in other languages:
Java - Interface
C++ - Concept
Swift - Protocol
Rust - Trait
